In the context of this Zomato project, I successfully utilized SQL functions including CASE WHEN, MEDIAN, AVERAGE, and COUNT to derive the following insights:
  1.What are the top 10 most common cuisines among listed restaurants?
  2.How many restaurants are there in each city?
  3.What is the distribution of restaurant ratings (average, minimum, maximum, median)?
  4.Is there a relationship between the number of votes and the overall aggregate rating of a restaurant?
  5.Are there any cities with a higher concentration of specific cuisines?
  6.How many restaurants offer a specific cuisine type?
  7.What is the average cost for two people for each cuisine?
and many more
