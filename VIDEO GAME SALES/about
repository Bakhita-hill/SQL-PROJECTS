In this project, i explored a video game sales dataset available on Kaggle using SQL queries to extract valuable insights.
The dataset contained information about various video games, including their titles, platforms, genres, sales figures in different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, etc.),
release years, and more.
My  goal was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the video game market by addressing a series of key questions. 
To achieve this, i leveraged SQL techniques to query the dataset effectively. Below are the questions  and the methods i used:
1.Total Sales Analysis:
To calculate the total global sales revenue for all games in the dataset, i  used the SQL `SUM` function to aggregate sales data across all records.

2. Top Selling Games:
I identified the top 10 best-selling games based on global sales. This involves sorting the data using the `ORDER BY` clause and selecting the top records using `TOP`.

3. Platform Popularity:
To determine the gaming platform with the most games released, I  used the `GROUP BY` clause to group data by platform and then count the number of records in each group.

4. Genre Analysis:
i found the top 5 most popular game genres in terms of the number of games released. This required grouping data by genre and counting the records in each group.

5. Yearly Sales Trend:
To analyze how global game sales have evolved over the years, i grouped data by year and use the `SUM` function to calculate yearly sales.

6. Region-Based Sales:
To determine the top 5 games in North America, Europe, and Japan in terms of sales, i  sorted the data based on sales in each region and used 'TOP` to select the top records.

7. Platform-Genre Combination:
To identify the platform-genre combination with the highest average sales, i grouped data by both platform and genre, then calculated the average sales for each combination.

8.Longest Title:
i found the game with the longest title character-wise by sorting the data based on the length of game titles by using the 'LEN'function and selecting the top record.
