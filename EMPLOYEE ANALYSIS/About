In the course of this project, I engaged with four distinct datasets comprising employee data, employee survey data, training data, and recruitment data.
These datasets encapsulated a diverse array of information, necessitating a comprehensive analytical approach.
My primary objectives centered around conducting both univariate and bivariate analyses to discern pertinent insights. To fulfill this mandate,
I leveraged SQL functions, strategically employing tools such as  various date functions ('year,' 'month,' 'datediff,' 'getdate'), statistical measures such as
average ,count, max ,sum,  round,  executed judicious joins and implemented conditional logic through 'case when' statements.
The analysis  offered a deep understanding of employee dynamics,survey responses, training outcomes, and recruitment trends.which provided a solid basis for 
informed decision-making and strategic planning.
